# ReplyMate Reply Quality Improvements

## Current Analysis

### Token Usage Breakdown
- **System Prompt**: ~250-300 tokens
- **User Message**: ~100-150 tokens (post content + comments)
- **Output Limit**: Previously 40 tokens, now increased to 80
- **Total Input**: ~400-450 tokens per request

### How Custom Prompts Work
1. Custom prompt is loaded from Chrome storage on each request
2. System prompt is sent as the first message (sets AI personality)
3. Post content is added as user message
4. Model generates response with token/stop constraints

## Implemented Improvements

### 1. Increased Output Quality
- ✅ Changed from 1 sentence (25 words) to 1-2 sentences (40 words)
- ✅ Increased `max_tokens` from 40 to 80
- ✅ Removed aggressive stop tokens (was stopping at first period)
- ✅ Better sentence joining logic

### 2. Generation Parameters
```javascript
// Before:
max_tokens: 40,
temperature: 0.7,
stop: ["\n", ".", "!", "?"]

// After:
max_tokens: 80,
temperature: 0.8,  // Slightly more creative
stop: ["\n\n", "\n\n\n"]  // Only stop on double newlines
```

## Additional Optimization Options

### Option 1: Concise Prompt Engineering
Replace verbose prompts with concise, token-efficient versions:

```javascript
// Compact prompt (saves ~100 tokens)
const EFFICIENT_PROMPT = `LinkedIn reply expert. Output: 1-2 sentences, max 40 words.

Analyze post for: key themes, tone, engagement opportunities.
Reply with: specific insight, thoughtful question, or unique perspective.
Style: conversational, professional, value-adding.
Never: generic praise, self-promotion.`;
```

### Option 2: Dynamic Token Allocation
```javascript
// Adjust tokens based on post complexity
const getOptimalTokens = (postLength: number) => {
  if (postLength < 100) return 60;
  if (postLength < 300) return 80;
  return 100; // Longer posts need more nuanced responses
};
```

### Option 3: Context-Aware Prompting
```javascript
// Different prompts for different post types
const POST_TYPE_PROMPTS = {
  announcement: "Congratulate specifically and ask about impact or next steps.",
  question: "Provide expert answer with example or counter-question.",
  opinion: "Agree/disagree with reasoning and add new perspective.",
  story: "Connect with shared experience or lesson learned."
};
```

### Option 4: Reply Templates with AI Enhancement
```javascript
// Semi-structured responses for consistency
const REPLY_TEMPLATES = [
  "{insight} + {question}",
  "{agreement} + {personal_experience}",
  "{specific_praise} + {related_observation}",
  "{data_point} + {implication}"
];
```

### Option 5: Multi-Model Strategy
```javascript
// Use different models for different scenarios
const selectModelForContext = (context) => {
  if (context.isTechnical) return "Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct"; // Best for technical
  if (context.needsSpeed) return "Phi-3.5-mini-instruct"; // Fastest
  return "Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct"; // Balanced default
};
```

## Testing Your Improvements

### A/B Testing Framework
```javascript
// Track reply performance
const trackReplyMetrics = {
  generated: 0,
  edited: 0,
  posted: 0,
  averageEditDistance: 0
};
```

### Quality Metrics to Monitor
1. **Relevance Score**: Does reply address post content?
2. **Engagement Score**: Does it invite further discussion?
3. **Uniqueness Score**: Avoids generic responses?
4. **Length Compliance**: Stays within word limits?

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Test Current Improvements**: The 1-2 sentence with 80 tokens should provide better results
2. **Monitor User Edits**: Track how often users modify generated replies
3. **Collect Feedback**: Add simple thumbs up/down after generation
4. **Iterate on Prompts**: Use feedback to refine prompt templates

## Custom Prompt Best Practices

### DO:
- Be specific about output format
- Include examples of good replies
- Mention tone and style preferences
- Set clear boundaries (word count, etc.)

### DON'T:
- Over-explain context (wastes tokens)
- Repeat instructions multiple times
- Use vague descriptors ("be creative")
- Include unnecessary formatting

## Example High-Performance Custom Prompt

```
You're a LinkedIn thought leader. Generate 1-2 sentences (max 40 words) that:
- Address ONE specific point from the post
- Add unique insight or ask engaging question
- Sound conversational yet professional
- Never use: "Great post", "Thanks for sharing", "Couldn't agree more"

Focus on value, not agreement.
```

This uses only ~50 tokens vs 250+ in verbose prompts, leaving more room for context and better outputs.
