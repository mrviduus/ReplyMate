2. Open any conversation
3. Click in the message compose area
4. Look for the auto-reply suggestion panel (may take a moment to appear)

   - General Settings
   - AI Models
   - Templates
   - Privacy

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Won't Load
- **Check the console**: Press F12 â†’ Console tab for errors
- **Verify file structure**: Ensure all files are in the `dist` folder
- **Check permissions**: Make sure Chrome can access the folder

### LinkedIn Integration Issues
- **Refresh LinkedIn page**: The extension needs to inject scripts
- **Check permissions**: Ensure the extension has access to LinkedIn
- **Console errors**: Check for JavaScript errors in browser console

### Model Loading Issues
- **Large files**: AI models are several GB and take time to download
- **Memory**: Ensure sufficient browser memory (close other tabs if needed)
- **Network**: Models download from Hugging Face servers

## Expected Behavior

### First Use
1. Extension popup shows "Models not loaded"
2. Click "Load Models" (this takes several minutes)
3. Models download and cache locally
4. Status changes to "Models ready"

### LinkedIn Usage
1. Navigate to LinkedIn messages
2. Click on a conversation
3. Start typing in the message box
4. Auto-reply suggestions appear in a floating panel
5. Click a suggestion to use it

### Privacy Note
- All AI processing happens locally in your browser
- No data is sent to external servers
- Models are cached locally for performance

## Debug Mode

To enable detailed logging:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Run: `localStorage.setItem('linkedin-autoreply-debug', 'true')`
3. Reload LinkedIn page
4. Check console for detailed logs

## Performance Notes

- **Memory Usage**: Large language models require significant RAM
- **Initial Load**: First model loading takes several minutes
- **Response Generation**: 1-5 seconds per response depending on model size
- **Browser Performance**: May slow down with multiple models loaded
