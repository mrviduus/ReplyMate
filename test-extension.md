## Testing AI Reply Generation on LinkedIn

### Background Service Worker Test

2. Click "service worker" link next to ReplyMate extension

### Troubleshooting

**If Reply button doesn't appear:**

- Refresh the page

**If AI generation fails:**
- Check the service worker console (`chrome://extensions/` > service worker)
- Look for WebLLM initialization errors
- The AI model download is ~4GB and happens on first use

**If getting fallback replies only:**
- Wait for background initialization to complete
- Check service worker console for "Background engine ready" message
- Try clicking the Reply button again after initialization

## Key Features Implemented

✅ **LinkedIn Reply Generation**: AI-powered professional replies directly on LinkedIn posts
✅ **Background AI Service**: Persistent AI that works without popup being open  
✅ **Native UI Integration**: Reply buttons styled to match LinkedIn's design
✅ **Status Feedback**: Loading states and error messages for better UX
✅ **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation when AI is initializing
✅ **Chat Interface**: Full conversational AI in extension popup
✅ **Close Popup Functionality**: Multiple ways to close popup after getting responses
  - Close button (×) next to copy button

## Architecture Overview

- **Background Service Worker**: Handles AI engine initialization and LinkedIn reply generation
- **Content Script**: Injects Reply buttons and handles LinkedIn DOM manipulation  
- **Popup**: Provides chat interface with independent AI engine
- **Persistent AI**: Background service stays alive using Chrome alarms API

The extension now properly separates AI functionality between background (for LinkedIn) and popup (for chat), ensuring LinkedIn replies work reliably without requiring the popup to be open.
