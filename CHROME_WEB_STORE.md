# Chrome Web Store Submission Guide

## ✅ Changes Applied (FINAL VERSION)

**Fixed "Broad Host Permissions" issue by:**
- ❌ **Removed**: `<all_urls>` content script (was causing broad permissions flag)
- ❌ **Removed**: `<all_urls>` web accessible resources (was causing broad permissions flag)
- ✅ **Optimized**: Single content script only for LinkedIn (`https://*.linkedin.com/*`)
- ✅ **Consolidated**: Generic content functionality moved into LinkedIn content script

**Current permissions (Chrome Web Store compliant):**
- ✅ `storage` - For user preferences and AI model data
- ✅ `tabs` - For extension communication  
- ✅ `activeTab` - For LinkedIn interaction on user action
- ✅ `windows` - For popup management
- ✅ `alarms` - For background operations
- ✅ `host_permissions: ["https://*.linkedin.com/*"]` - LinkedIn-specific only

## 📝 Privacy Practices Tab Justifications

Copy and paste these justifications into your Chrome Web Store Privacy Practices tab:

### activeTab Permission
**Justification:**
```
ReplyMate needs activeTab to interact with LinkedIn pages when users click to generate AI replies. This allows reading the post content for context and inserting the generated reply into comment fields. The permission activates only on user action, ensuring privacy and compliance with user intent.
```

### tabs Permission  
**Justification:**
```
Required for communication between the extension popup and LinkedIn content scripts to coordinate AI reply generation. Used only to send messages between extension components, not to access or monitor browsing activity.
```

### storage Permission
**Justification:**
```
Stores user preferences, AI model settings, and chat history locally in the user's browser. No data is transmitted to external servers - all information remains private and local to the user's device.
```

### windows Permission
**Justification:**
```
Manages the extension's popup window interface where users interact with the AI chat feature. Used only for controlling the extension's own UI windows.
```

### alarms Permission
**Justification:**
```
Handles background tasks for AI model initialization and session management. Ensures the AI engine remains responsive for reply generation without impacting browser performance.
```
