# Chrome Web Store Submission Guide

## ‚úÖ Changes Applied

**Removed unused permission:**
- ‚ùå `webNavigation` - Removed from manifest.json (was not being used in the code)

**Current permissions:**
- ‚úÖ `storage` - For user preferences and AI model data
- ‚úÖ `tabs` - For extension communication
- ‚úÖ `activeTab` - For LinkedIn interaction on user action
- ‚úÖ `windows` - For popup management
- ‚úÖ `alarms` - For background operations

## üìù Privacy Practices Tab Justifications

Copy and paste these justifications into your Chrome Web Store Privacy Practices tab:

### activeTab Permission
**Justification:**
```
ReplyMate needs activeTab to interact with LinkedIn pages when users click to generate AI replies. This allows reading the post content for context and inserting the generated reply into comment fields. The permission activates only on user action, ensuring privacy and compliance with user intent.
```

### tabs Permission  
**Justification:**
```
Required for communication between the extension popup and LinkedIn content scripts to coordinate AI reply generation. Used only to send messages between extension components, not to access or monitor browsing activity.
```

### storage Permission
**Justification:**
```
Stores user preferences, AI model settings, and chat history locally in the user's browser. No data is transmitted to external servers - all information remains private and local to the user's device.
```

### windows Permission
**Justification:**
```
Manages the extension's popup window interface where users interact with the AI chat feature. Used only for controlling the extension's own UI windows.
```

### alarms Permission
**Justification:**
```
Handles background tasks for AI model initialization and session management. Ensures the AI engine remains responsive for reply generation without impacting browser performance.
```

## üè™ Chrome Web Store Submission Steps

1. **Upload New Package:**
   - Use the updated `packages/ReplyMate-v0.2.0.zip`
   - This version has the `webNavigation` permission removed

2. **Privacy Practices Tab:**
   - Add the justifications above for each permission
   - Ensure all required fields are completed

3. **Store Listing:**
   - Verify your description mentions privacy-first approach
   - Highlight that AI processing happens locally
   - Mention LinkedIn integration capabilities

4. **Submit for Review:**
   - The extension should now pass the permission review
   - All permissions are properly justified and actually used in the code

## üîç What Was Changed

### Before (had compliance issues):
```json
"permissions": ["storage", "tabs", "webNavigation", "activeTab", "windows", "alarms"]
```

### After (Chrome Web Store compliant):
```json
"permissions": ["storage", "tabs", "activeTab", "windows", "alarms"]
```

**Key improvement:** Removed unused `webNavigation` permission that was causing the submission requirement for justification without actual usage in the code.
