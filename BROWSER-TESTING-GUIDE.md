# LinkedIn Auto-Reply Extension - Browser Testing Guide

## ✅ Prototype Ready for Testing

The LinkedIn Auto-Reply extension prototype has been successfully built and is ready for browser testing.

### 📊 Build Summary
- **Service Worker**: Clean, no DOM references (9 KB)
- **Offscreen Document**: Contains AI/ML logic (837 KB)
- **AI Model**: FLAN-T5-small int8 ONNX (137 MB)
- **Total Extension Size**: 604 MB (prototype - optimization pending)

### 🧪 Browser Testing Steps

#### 1. Load Extension in Chrome/Edge
1. Open Chrome or Edge browser
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` (or `edge://extensions/`)
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the `dist/` folder from this project
6. Extension should load with name "LinkedIn Auto-Reply Assistant"

#### 2. Verify Extension Loading
- ✅ Extension appears in extensions list
- ✅ No registration errors in browser console
- ✅ Service worker shows "activated" status
- ✅ Extension icon appears in browser toolbar

#### 3. Test Offscreen Document Initialization
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for messages from the extension:
   - "Service Worker initializing..."
   - "Offscreen document created for AI processing"
   - "ORT ready" (should appear within 3 seconds)

#### 4. Test on LinkedIn
1. Visit [LinkedIn Messages](https://www.linkedin.com/messaging/)
2. Open any conversation or start a new message
3. Look for auto-reply UI elements injected by the extension
4. Test the "Generate Draft" functionality

#### 5. Expected Behavior
- ✅ Service worker activates without errors
- ✅ Offscreen document loads and logs "ORT ready"
- ✅ Content script injects UI on LinkedIn
- ✅ Draft generation produces AI-powered responses
- ✅ No console errors during normal operation

### 🔍 Troubleshooting

#### Extension Won't Load
- Check browser version (Chrome 109+ or Edge 109+ required for offscreen API)
- Verify all files are present in dist/ folder
- Check browser console for specific error messages

#### Service Worker Errors
- Check if service worker shows "activated" in chrome://extensions/
- Look for initialization errors in DevTools console
- Verify offscreen permission is granted

#### Offscreen Document Issues
- Check if "ORT ready" message appears in console
- Large model size may cause initial loading delay
- Memory constraints may affect model loading

#### LinkedIn Integration Problems
- Verify content script is injected (check DevTools Sources tab)
- LinkedIn's dynamic UI may require page refresh
- Check for content security policy conflicts
